# Simulation-and-Control-of-Self-Balancing-Two-Wheeled-Robot

## Overview
Balancing a two wheeled robot is based on the inverted pendulum concept. Its applications are  widely used in the controlling of “Segway”, which are used for transportation purposes. Human body also balances the upper body through the ankle joints based on the same concept. Balancing the center of mass (COM) achieves the required control of the systems in these cases.
